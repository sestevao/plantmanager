You can view the project layout via [this link](https://www.figma.com/file/IhQRtrOZdu3TrvkPYREzOy/PlantManager). Remembering that you need to have a Figma account to access it.

## ‚úÖ Getting started

Use **yarn** or **npm install** to install project dependencies. Then start the project and fake API with JSON Server.

```bash
# Clone the project and access the folder
$ gh repo clone sestevao/plantmanager
$ cd plantmanager

# now predicting that you already have node.js with npm or yarn on your
# computer, install the global expo cli with the command
$ npm install --global expo-cli
# or
$ yarn add expo-cli

# after that, just run the following commands on separate terminals to run the fake server
$ json-server ./src/services/server.json --host myIp --port 3333 --delay 700

# Finally run the project in a development environment
$ expo start

# and just open it on your emulator or device using Expo
# Well done, PlantManager is started!
```

Replace the host with your local **IP address**. Do the same for the API file inside services.

```javascript
import axios from "axios";

const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: "http://myIp:3333",
});

export default api;
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Remember to use your machine's IP address**
